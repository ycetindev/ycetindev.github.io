As anyone who's tasted the joy of driving a brushless motor with a microcontroller knows, I'm always on the hunt for faster ways to perform trigonometric calculations. While standard math library functions or look-up tables can sometimes be fast enough, there are situations where we need even greater performance, especially when minimizing the execution time and flash usage is a priority. This is where the CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) coprocessor in STM32G4 microcontrollers can be a game-changer.

In motor control applications, we frequently need to perform coordinate transformations, such as the Clarke and Park transformations, to convert between the ABC and dq reference frames. These transformations involve calculating sine and cosine functions, which can be computationally intensive, particularly when the control loop runs at high frequencies (typically 10-100 kHz).

Here's a quick recap of the mathematical background:

![Reference frames used in motor control: https://www.mathworks.com/help/sps/powersys/ref/abctodq0dq0toabc.html](/assets/ref_frames.bmp)

The Clarke-Park transform equations for converting phase currents to the dq frame are:

$$i_d = \frac{2}{3} \left[i_a \cos(\theta) + i_b \cos \left( \theta - \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right) + i_c \cos \left( \theta + \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right) \right] $$

$$i_q = -\frac{2}{3}\left[i_a \sin(\theta) + i_b \sin\left(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) + i_c \sin\left(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}\right)\right]$$

These calculations need to be performed repeatedly at the PWM update rate, making efficient trigonometric calculations a critical requirement.

Using the trigonometric addition formulas, 

$$ cos(a+b) = cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b) $$

$$sin(a+b) = sin(a)cos(b) + cos(a)sin(b)$$

In the end, ABC-DQ conversion can be simplified as below.

$$i_d = 0.6667[cos(\theta)i_a+(0.866sin(\theta)-0.5cos(\theta)i_b+(-0.866sin(\theta)-0.5cos(\theta))i_c] $$ 

$$i_q = 0.6667[-sin(\theta)i_a-(-0.866cos(\theta)-0.5sin(\theta))i_b-(0.866cos(\theta)-0.5sin(\theta))i_c] $$

So, we need to calculate sine and cosine values each time we need to run our control loops in DQ reference frame, depending on the PWM frequency/update rate, typically varies between 10kHz to 100kHz.

Now, let's start to have a look to CORDIC registers and configuration in STM32G4:

Here you can see the supported functions by CORDIC.

To use the CORDIC coprocessor, we need to configure a few key registers:

- CORDIC_CSR (Control and Status Register)
![cordic_csr](/assets/cordic_csr.png)
- CORDIC_WDATA (Write Data Register)
- CORDIC_RDATA (Read Data Register)

that's it.

Here's an example of how to initialize the CORDIC peripheral:

```c
void CORDIC_init(void)
{
    // Enable CORDIC clock
    RCC->AHB1ENR |= RCC_AHB1ENR_CORDICEN;
    
    // Configure for 32-bit operation with sine function
    CORDIC->CSR = 0x00;
    CORDIC->CSR |= CORDIC_CSR_ARGSIZE | CORDIC_CSR_RESSIZE | CORDIC_CSR_FUNC_0;
    
    // Set precision (12 iterations)
    CORDIC->CSR |= CORDIC_CSR_PRECISION_2;
    // Note: CORDIC performs 4 iterations per clock cycle
    // 12 iterations = 3 clock cycles with max residual error of 2^-11
}
```

## Performance Comparison

To evaluate the performance of the CORDIC coprocessor, I implemented both the traditional math library and CORDIC-based approaches for calculating sine/cosine and performing the dq transformations. Using the DWT cycle counter (covered in my [previous post]([link-to-dwt-post](https://ycetindev.github.io/posts/2024-10-30-code-execution-time-on-arm-cortex-m-mcus.html))) and UART printing (explained [here]([link-to-uart-post](https://ycetindev.github.io/posts/2024-11-01-Redirecting-printf-to-UART.html))), I measured the execution times:

```c

// Fetch vars
theta = thetaArrayFull[arr_idx];
Iabc.Ia = IaArrayFull[arr_idx];
Iabc.Ib = IbArrayFull[arr_idx];
Iabc.Ic = -(Iabc.Ia + Iabc.Ib);

// Math lib
ET_math.start = *ET_DWT_CYCCNT;
trg_math.theta = theta;
trg_math.cos = cosf(trg_math.theta);
trg_math.sin = sinf(trg_math.theta);
Idq_math = ABC2DQ(Iabc, trg_math);
ET_math.stop = *ET_DWT_CYCCNT;
ET_math.elapsedcnt = ET_math.stop - ET_math.start;
ET_math.elapsedus = ET_math.elapsedcnt / CLK_FRQ_MHZ;
if(ET_math.elapsedus > ET_math.elapsedusmax)
	ET_math.elapsedusmax = ET_math.elapsedus;

// CORDIC
ET_cordic.start = *ET_DWT_CYCCNT;
trg_cordic.theta = theta;
trg_cordic = CORDIC_th2CS(theta);
Idq_cordic = ABC2DQ(Iabc, trg_cordic);
ET_cordic.stop = *ET_DWT_CYCCNT;
ET_cordic.elapsedcnt = ET_cordic.stop - ET_cordic.start;
ET_cordic.elapsedus = ET_cordic.elapsedcnt / CLK_FRQ_MHZ;
if(ET_cordic.elapsedus > ET_cordic.elapsedusmax)
	ET_cordic.elapsedusmax = ET_cordic.elapsedus;
```


The results are quite impressive:

## Conclusion

The CORDIC coprocessor in STM32G4 microcontrollers provides a powerful solution for accelerating trigonometric calculations in motor control applications. As we've seen from the performance measurements, it significantly reduces execution time compared to standard math library functions while maintaining accuracy.

This hardware acceleration is particularly valuable in high-frequency control loops where every microsecond counts. While we've achieved great results with floating-point calculations, there's potential for even better performance using fixed-point arithmetic - perhaps a topic for a future post!
