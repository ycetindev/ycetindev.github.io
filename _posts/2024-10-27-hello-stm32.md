As embedded software engineers, we often take the build process for granted. While we can create working programs without fully understanding what happens behind the scenes, knowing these details becomes crucial when debugging complex issues or optimizing our applications. In this post, we'll dive into the build process, starting with the basics and then moving to embedded-specific considerations using STM32 as our example.

## Build Process Overview

The journey from source code to executable involves three main steps:
1. Preprocessing
2. Compilation
3. Linking

Let's understand what's happening in each step.

### Preprocessing: The First Transform

Preprocessing is the simplest step, where `#include` files, definitions, and macros are resolved to prepare the whole source file for compilation. Understanding this process is valuable for writing clearer, more maintainable code at higher levels.

### Compilation: From Source to Object Files

During compilation, the compiler first checks the syntax of each statement against the selected standard. If everything is correct, it generates `.s` files (assembly), which are then converted into `.o` files (object files) containing machine code.

### Linking: Bringing It All Together

The linker combines all object files to generate the final executable. For example, if you have three source files (`main.c`, `adc.c`, `timer.c`), you'll have three corresponding object files (`main.o`, `adc.o`, `timer.o`) at the linking stage, each containing its own machine code.

The linker's job is to merge all these machine codes into one executable file. When using the GCC compiler, this results in an `.elf` format file. Optionally, additional post-processing can generate other formats like `.bin` or `.hex`.

## Part 1: Understanding Build Process on Desktop

Let's start with a simple example to understand these concepts better. We'll first build and debug our program on a desktop platform before moving to embedded systems.

### A Simple Program

```c
int main(void)
{
    int my_var = 0;
    while(1)
    {
        my_var += 1;
    }
}
```

### Examining the Assembly Output

Let's first look at what our C code becomes in assembly:

```bash
>>gcc -S main.c
```

The resulting assembly file (`main.s`) shows us the actual instructions:

```bash
        .file   "main.c"
        .def    ___main;        .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
        .text
        .globl  _main
        .def    _main;  .scl    2;      .type   32;     .endef
_main:
LFB0:
        .cfi_startproc
        pushl   %ebp
        .cfi_def_cfa_offset 8
        .cfi_offset 5, -8
        movl    %esp, %ebp
        .cfi_def_cfa_register 5
        andl    $-16, %esp
        subl    $16, %esp
        call    ___main
        movl    $0, 12(%esp)
L2:
        addl    $1, 12(%esp)
        jmp     L2
        .cfi_endproc
LFE0:
        .ident  "GCC: (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0"
```

### Creating and Examining Object Files

Next, let's create the object file:

```bash
>>gcc -c main.c
```

The object file (`main.o`) contains machine code, which isn't human-readable when displayed:

```bash
>>type main.o
L☺♣h☺☼♦☺.text ▄T☺☺ 0`.data@0└.bssÇ0└/4$³@0@/154 ☺^☺☺@0@UëÕâõ­âý►ÞÃD$♀âD$♀☺Ù¨ÉÉÉGCC: (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0...
```

### Debugging the Program

Let's compile with debug symbols and examine the program's behavior:

```bash
>>gcc -g main.c -o maindebug
```

Using GDB to debug our program:

```bash
>>gdb maindebug.exe
(gdb) break 7
Breakpoint 1 at 0x401476: file main.c, line 7.
(gdb) run
```

Our debugging session shows the variable incrementing as expected:

```bash
Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:7
7               my_var += 1;
(gdb) p my_var
$1 = 0
(gdb) next

Breakpoint 1, main () at main.c:7
7               my_var += 1;
(gdb) p my_var
$2 = 1
```

### Understanding Linker's Impact

Let's compare the sizes of our object file and final executable:

```bash
>>size main.o
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    120       0       0     120      78 main.o

>>size mymain.exe
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  14340    1532     112   15984    3e70 mymain.exe
```

Notice how the final executable is much larger than our object file - this is because the linker adds runtime support code and necessary library functions.

## Part 2: Moving to Embedded Systems

Now that we understand the basic build process, let's see how it changes when targeting an STM32 microcontroller. We'll use the same simple program but with additional requirements for embedded systems.

### Memory Mapping

For STM32F303VC, we need to understand the memory layout:

- SRAM: 48KB total (40KB usable, 8KB CRAM)
- Flash: 256KB

The memory maps from the Technical Reference Manual show us where these memories are located:

![SRAM Memory Map](/_assets/mm_sram.png)

![Flash Memory Map](/_assets/mm_flash.png)

### Creating the Linker Script

Based on the memory map, we create a minimal linker script:

```c
/* Minimal linker script for STM32F303VCT6. */ 

_estack = 0x2000A000; /* RAM starting address + 40KB of RAM (0xA000) */
MEMORY
{
    FLASH (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 256K
    RAM (rxw)   : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 40K
}
```

### Setting Up the Vector Table

For embedded systems, we need a vector table to handle system startup and interrupts. The good thing is most of the interrupts are disabled by default, so we just need to specify reset handler for the time being, just to tell the core what to do in case of system reset/power up:

```assembly
.syntax unified
.cpu cortex-m4 
.fpu softvfp
.thumb

.global vtable
.global reset_handler

.type vtable, %object
vtable:
    .word _estack
    .word reset_handler
.size vtable, .-vtable

.type reset_handler, %function
reset_handler:
    LDR r0, =_estack
    MOV sp, r0
    B main
.size reset_handler, .-reset_handler
```

### Building for STM32

The build process now requires cross-compilation tools:

Compile assembly code:
```bash
arm-none-eabi-gcc -x assembler-with-cpp -c -O0 -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -Wall mycore.s -o mycore.o
```

Compile C code:
```bash
arm-none-eabi-gcc -c -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -Wall -g -fmessage-length=0 --specs=nosys.specs main.c -o mymain.o
```

Link everything together:
```bash
arm-none-eabi-gcc mycore.o mymain.o -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -Wall --specs=nosys.specs -nostdlib -lgcc -T./mylinkerscript.ld -o myexec.elf
```

### Examining the Output

The symbols in our final executable show where everything is placed in memory:

```bash
>arm-none-eabi-nm myexec.elf

2000a000 A _estack
08000014 T main
08000008 T reset_handler
08000000 T vtable
```

### Debugging on the Target

Finally, we can debug our program running on the actual hardware:

```bash
(gdb) load myexec.elf 
Loading section .text, size 0x26 lma 0x8000000
Start address 0x08000000, load size 38
Transfer rate: 109 bytes/sec, 38 bytes/write.
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.
0x08000024 in main () at main.c:7
7               my_var += 1;
(gdb) p my_var
$1 = 1780275
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.
0x08000020 in main () at main.c:7
7               my_var += 1;
(gdb) p my_var
$2 = 4829366
```

This demonstrates our program running successfully on the target hardware, with our variable incrementing as expected.

## Conclusion

What we've covered here represents the bare minimum needed to run software on an STM32 microcontroller. Understanding the build process isn't just theoretical knowledge - it's a practical tool that proves invaluable when optimizing code or debugging complex issues in embedded systems.

I should also mention about STM32's Developer Zone offers excellent tools like CubeMX, CubeIDE, and CubeProgrammer that significantly simplify this process, we can explore these in a future blog post to compare the approaches. However, there's something uniquely powerful about understanding what happens underneath these abstractions, and remember - sometimes you need to peek under the hood to truly master your craft!
