Ever tried to explain how a microcontroller actually runs your "Hello World" program? Or found yourself diving deep into timer configurations just to blink an LED? Welcome to the fascinating world of embedded systems, where even the simplest tasks can unveil layers of complexity.

I'm an embedded software engineer with 7+ years of experience in bringing hardware to life through code. Throughout my journey from writing my first interrupt handler to architecting complex embedded applications, I've learned that our field is built on details - details that we sometimes gloss over early in our careers, only to rediscover their importance when pushing the boundaries of hardware capabilities or mentoring the next generation of engineers.

This blog is my attempt to document these discoveries - from the fundamentals that suddenly "click" years into your career, to the intricate technical challenges that emerge when working with resource-constrained systems. You'll find posts ranging from bare-metal firmware development to control engineering principles, power electronics considerations, and everything in between.

Why am I doing this? Primarily for myself - to organize my thoughts and document solutions to problems I've encountered. But if these notes help another engineer understand a concept better or solve a tricky problem, that's a welcome bonus. Think of this as a growing collection of field notes from someone who's still learning something new about embedded systems every day.

Fair warning: these are my personal experiences and approaches. While I strive for accuracy, there's often more than one way to solve a problem in embedded development. So take everything here with a pinch of salt, and feel free to explore, question, and adapt these ideas to your own projects.
